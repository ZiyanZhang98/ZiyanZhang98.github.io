I am a Ph.D. student in the [MNS Group](https://mns-research.nl/) at [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/), advised by Prof. [Paola Grosso](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cXsfHbsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Before joining UvA, I obtained my master of engineering in the [Superconducting Quantum Computing](https://siqse.sustech.edu.cn/Zh/Index/index?play=0), [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/).
