I am a Ph.D. student at University of Amsterdam, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Paola Grosso](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cXsfHbsAAAAJ) and [Dr. Florian Speelman](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=hX_ToHkAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained my Master of Engineering from the Superconducting Quantum Computing Lab, Southern University of Science and Technology. During my master's studies, I was fortunate to work under the guidance of [Dr. Fei Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GRj9Hk0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Prof. Yuan Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gkON9RkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 


Research Interests
======
Affiliated with the [Quantum Delta Netherlands Programme](https://quantumdelta.nl/), I am currently conducting research on the integration of quantum and classical computing science, encompassing areas such as complexity theory and quantum information.
