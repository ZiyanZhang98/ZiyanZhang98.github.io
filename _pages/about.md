I am a Ph.D. student affiliated with the [MNS Group](https://mns-research.nl/) at [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/), under the supervision of Prof. [Paola Grosso](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cXsfHbsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained my Master of Engineering from the [Superconducting Quantum Computing Lab](https://siqse.sustech.edu.cn/Zh/Index/index?play=0), [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/). During my master's studies, I was fortunate to work under the guidance of Prof. [Fei Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GRj9Hk0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and Prof. [Yuan Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gkON9RkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 


Research Interests
======
I am currently researching the integration of quantum and classical computing systems, seeking to harness their combined power. My focus lies in understanding and optimizing hybrid setups to revolutionize computational capabilities and drive technological advancements.
