I am a Ph.D. student in the [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Kun Zhang](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/) ([CMU-CLeaR Group](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/causality/)). Prior to CMU, I was a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Meta](https://about.facebook.com/), Ads Core ML team. In 2017, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science and B.S. in Mathematics with highest distinction at [the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Dan Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/) and Prof. [AJ Hildebrand](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~hildebr/).

Research Interests
======
My research goal is to build better machine learning methods using mathematical insights. My current work mainly focuses on two areas:

1. Working at Meta gave me lots of experience with real problems in the world of machine learning, especially when it comes to making recommendations for large scale ad systems. I'm now focusing on identifying these issues and coming up with principled ways to fix them. One example is dealing with the [maximization bias problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09809).

2. The other area I'm interested in is how we can use machine learning to solve problems in quantitative finance, which I think holds a lot of promise.

While I'm generally interested in everything to do with machine learning, my current research is mainly about causal representation learning, and how we can use it in quantitative finance. I'm also interested in related areas, like how we can generalize beyond the data we've seen so far (i.e. out-of-distribution generalization).
